VARIABLE DEFINITIONS:

fisherCode: Cryptic indicator of contributor

cpueYear: Year for which average CPUE is described

yearSerial: cpueYear as a serialised value

birthDate: Contributor's year of birth

fishingDates: Interval of dates working in the green turtle fishery

experience: Years of experience in the green turtle fishery (ordinal)
    1 = 1-5 years
    2 = 6-10 yeas
    3 = 11-15 years

generation: Category of cohorts of fishers define based on the fishery stages in 
which the contributor worked

    2 = Fishers who worked during the collapse stage
    3 = Fishers who worked through all stages

rawCpue: Average number of turtles caught in one night (approx. 12 hours) during 
cpueYear (unstandardised).

logRawCpue: Log-transformed raw CPUE

stCpue: Standardized value for average number of turtles caught in one night 
(approx. 12 hours) during cpueYear.

stage: Stages of the green turtle fishery
    1 = Initial development 
    2 = Commercial fishing (harpoon)

harpoonSkill: Harpooner skill coefficient (Not assigned to captures with nets)
    Percentage of success (50-99%)

totalNetLength: length of nets used (m x 10^2) obtained by numNets * netLength

stageString: Fishery stage as a string value

totalLanding: Annual green turtle landings in BLA (tonnes/year), from Márquez
